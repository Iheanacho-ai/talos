title: "Interactive Dashboard"
description: "A tool to inspect the running Talos machine state on the physical video console."

Interactive dashboard is enabled for all Talos platforms except for SBC images.
The dashboard can be disabled with kernel parameter `talos.dashboard.disabled=1`.

The dashboard runs only on the physical video console (not serial console) on the 2nd virtual TTY.
The first virtual TTY shows kernel logs same as in Talos <1.4.0.
The virtual TTYs can be switched with `<Alt+F1>` and `<Alt+F2>` keys.

Keys `<F1>` - `<Fn>` can be used to switch between different screens of the dashboard.

The dashboard is using either UEFI framebuffer or VGA/VESA framebuffer (for legacy BIOS boot).

## Dashboard Resolution Control

On legacy BIOS systems, the screen resolution can be adjusted with the [`vga=` kernel parameter](https://docs.kernel.org/fb/vesafb.html).

In modern kernels and platforms, this parameter is often ignored. For reliable results, it is recommended to boot with **UEFI**.

When running in **UEFI mode**, you can set the screen resolution through your hypervisor or UEFI firmware settings.

## Summary Screen (`F1`)

{{< imgproc "interactive-dashboard-1.png" Fit "920x920" >}}

{{< /imgproc >}}

The header shows brief information about the node:

* hostname
* Talos version
* uptime
* CPU and memory hardware information
* CPU and memory load, number of processes

Table view presents summary information about the machine:

* UUID (from SMBIOS data)
* Cluster name (when the machine config is available)
* Machine stage: `Installing`, `Upgrading`, `Booting`, `Maintenance`, `Running`, `Rebooting`, `Shutting down`, etc.
* Machine stage readiness: checks Talos service status, static pod status, etc. (for `Running` stage)
* Machine type: controlplane/worker
* Number of members discovered in the cluster
* Kubernetes version
* Status of Kubernetes components: `kubelet` and Kubernetes controlplane components (only on `controlplane` machines)
* Network information: Hostname, Addresses, Gateway, Connectivity, DNS and NTP servers

Bottom part of the screen shows kernel logs, same as on the virtual TTY 1.

## Monitor Screen (`F2`)

Monitor screen provides live view of the machine resource usage: CPU, memory, disk, network and processes.

## Network Config Screen (`F3`)

> Note: network config screen is only available for `metal` platform.

Network config screen provides editing capabilities for the `metal` [platform network configuration]({{< relref "install/bare-metal-platforms/network-config" >}}).

The screen is split into three sections:

* the leftmost section provides a way to enter network configuration: hostname, DNS and NTP servers, configure the network interface either via DHCP or static IP address, etc.
* the middle section shows the current network configuration.
* the rightmost section shows the network configuration which will be applied after pressing "Save" button.

Once the platform network configuration is saved, it is immediately applied to the machine.

## Running the Dashboard on a Serial Console

In some environments you might want to run the dashboard on a serial console instead of (or in addition to) VGA.
This is useful for:

* Headless servers with no physical monitor
* Serial-over-LAN (IPMI, iKVM, BMC)
* Hypervisors that only expose serial consoles

Talos itself does not (yet) natively launch the dashboard on serial consoles.
However, it can be achieved today with a privileged DaemonSet that attaches `/sbin/dashboard` to the hostâ€™s active serial TTY.

Example manifest:

```yaml
# ds.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: serial-console
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: serial-console
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: serial-console
    spec:
      hostPID: true
      containers:
        - name: dashboard
          image: busybox:1.36
          securityContext:
            privileged: true
          env:
            - name: TERM
              value: linux
          command: ["/bin/sh","-c"]
          args:
            - |
              set -eu

              echo "=== detect active console ==="
              ACTIVE="$(cat /hostfs/sys/class/tty/console/active 2>/dev/null || true)"
              DEV=""
              if [ -n "$ACTIVE" ]; then
                for t in $ACTIVE; do
                  [ "$t" = "tty0" ] && continue
                  [ -e "/dev/$t" ] && DEV="/dev/$t" && break
                done
              fi

              if [ -z "${DEV:-}" ]; then
                for d in /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyAMA0 /dev/hvc0; do
                  [ -e "$d" ] && DEV="$d" && break
                done
              fi

              : "${DEV:?no serial TTY found}"
              echo "Using $DEV"
              stty -F "$DEV" raw -echo -ixon speed 115200 || true

              [ -S /system/run/machined/machine.sock ] || ln -sf /hostfs/system/run /system/run || true

              while true; do
                echo "Starting dashboard on $DEV ..."
                setsid sh -c "exec < $DEV > $DEV 2>&1 /hostfs/sbin/dashboard" || true
                sleep 5
              done
          volumeMounts:
            - { name: dev,         mountPath: /dev }
            - { name: hostfs,      mountPath: /hostfs, readOnly: true }
            - { name: system-run,  mountPath: /system/run }
      volumes:
        - { name: dev,        hostPath: { path: /dev } }
        - { name: hostfs,     hostPath: { path: / } }
        - { name: system-run, hostPath: { path: /system/run } }
```

Apply the manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ds.yaml

```

Connect to the serial console via your host or IPMI/iKVM; the Talos dashboard should then open in its ncurses interface:
